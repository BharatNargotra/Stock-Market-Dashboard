Made for JarNox technical assignment.

If you want, I can now adjust the docker-compose.yml so it automatically builds the backend with SQLite instead of PostgreSQL for simpler setup.
Do you want me to make it SQLite-only? That way no DB container is needed.

About my Experience

While making the Stock Market Dashboard, I didnâ€™t try to finish everything at once. I first worked on the basic layout â€” one side showing a list of companies and the other side for the stock chart. Once that looked fine, I focused on making the UI simple and easy to use. After that, I connected the data part, first with a sample CSV file, and later tried fetching live stock data. The final step was to make sure when I clicked on a company, its stock data showed up properly on the chart.

For building it, I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to handle the front design. I also tried React.js with Recharts for showing stock graphs, which made the charts look much cleaner and interactive. On the backend, I used Python (Flask) to connect and manage data, and pandas helped me organize the stock info. For testing, I sometimes just used sample/mock data instead of live APIs, which made debugging easier.

The biggest challenges I faced were handling live data (it didnâ€™t always update smoothly), making sure the charts changed instantly when I clicked a company, and keeping the design responsive on different screens. Another small struggle was organizing the project files so that frontend, backend, and data didnâ€™t get messy. Even though these things were frustrating at times, fixing them gave me a better idea of how real dashboards actually work...
